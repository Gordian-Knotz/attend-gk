# Context & sessions

Working notes from the AttendPAC v1 → v2 merge, written so the reasoning
behind the current state of this repo survives past the session that
produced it. The root `README.md` tells you how to run the thing; these
files tell you why it looks the way it does.

Session date: **6 August 2026**. Everything below reflects the repo at the
commit that closed that session.

| File | What's in it |

| [02-merge-decisions.md](02-merge-decisions.md) | Which direction the merge ran, what was ported, what was discarded, and the reasoning for each call |

## The short version

Two independent builds of the same product existed: `attend-v1` and
`attend-v2`, both Next.js + Supabase, neither under version control.

The working assumption going in was "v1 is stronger on frontend, v2 has the
backend." The audit didn't support that. **v2 was ahead on both** — it has a
real design system, a component library, and roughly 4,300 lines of working
app code against v1's 1,200. v1's genuine advantages were narrower and
specific: more marketing copy, working charts, a cross-org admin view, and
password reset.

So: **v2 became the base, and v1's real wins were rebuilt inside it.** No v1
code was copied verbatim — its Supabase clients don't run on Next 15, and
its data model is incompatible with v2's. See
[02-merge-decisions.md](02-merge-decisions.md) for the full rationale.

`attend-v1` was left untouched on disk as a reference copy. Nothing in this
repo depends on it.

## A note on this folder's name

The `&` in "context & sessions" needs quoting in most shells:

```bash
cd "context & sessions"
```

Renaming it to `context-and-sessions` would remove that friction if it
becomes annoying.
